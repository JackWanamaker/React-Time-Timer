Okay, what are my next steps? I want to apply the same type of code to the threeNum handler

It doesn't necessarily have to be the BEST for that situation, but I just want to apply the same
philosophy.

Okay so the structure of these two differs for sure. 

Instead I am using the values from e.target.value

Okay so the oneNumHandler uses the boolean to basically compress the two different cases into one statement. For this other one, I don't want to do that...
